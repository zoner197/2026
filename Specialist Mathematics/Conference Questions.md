Hopes And Dreams: None

# High Priority
1. Is assuming the player will pick a random slot a good idea given that part C is solving for the best slot?
2. Where do we need sample calculations?

# Low Priority
1. Are my figures properly formatted?
2. Are formulas and images with text included in the word limit?
	1. ~~Does this mean I can take a screenshot of my PSMT?~~
