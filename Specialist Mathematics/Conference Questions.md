Hopes And Dreams: None

# High Priority
1. Is assuming the player will pick a random slot a good idea given that part C is solving for the best slot?
2. Where do we need sample calculations?

> An element in the merged Pascal's Triangle is the sum of all overlapping elements in that position.
> Take row 2, element 2, denoted as ${{2}\choose{2}}$ from now on, as an example:
> $$
\binom{2}{2}_{merged} = \binom{2}{2}_{triangle\space1} + \binom{2}{1}_{triangle\space2} + \binom{2}{0}_{triangle\space3} = 4
$$
3. Does the above need further explanation?

# Low Priority
1. Are my figures properly formatted?
2. Are formulas and images with text included in the word limit?
	1. ~~Does this mean I can take a screenshot of my PSMT?~~
