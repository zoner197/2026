# Abstract
The Wall is a game show where contestants answer general knowledge questions and get to drop a ball into a quincunx if correct. They can pick from one of four slots to drop the ball from, and it can fall into one of eight bins.

Each bin contains one of the following:
- Minimum Prize: $0
- Maximum Prize: $50,000
- Try Again: Contestant can redrop. On the redrop, the Try Again value is replaced with $6000.
- Multiplier: Contestant can redrop, but all bin values except Try Again and Multiplier are multiplier by 1.5. Try Again remains $6000, while Multiplier is replaced with $0.
- The four remaining bins contain different prize values between $0 and $50,000.

Through the use of Python and combinatorics, this investigation aims to:
1. Analyze the probability distribution of all bins.
2. Assign values to each bin that are within $\pm5\%$ of the Expected Return ($2000).
3. Find the best slot for contestants to drop the ball into.

## Observations
- Contestants cannot get a redrop within a redrop due to the Try Again and Multiplier values being replaced. This is essential, because calculations would be recursive otherwise, leading to infinite expected values.
- The shape of the quincunx is four merged Pascal's Triangles, allowing for probability and path calculations through combinatorics.
## Assumptions
- On a multiplier redrop, the Try Again value is not multiplied. This is an essential assumption to ensure that the expected value remains constant.
- The pegs are evenly spaced, the ball cannot bounce, and friction/air resistance are negligible, so there is exactly a 50% chance of the ball falling either side. This assumption is crucial for the use of Pascal's Triangle and combinatorics in the bin probability calculations.
