# Retrieval
1. Describe latent heat of fusion
Heat required to change a solid to a liquid or released when a liquid turns to a solid, at constant temperature and pressure.
2. State the Zeroth and First law of thermodynamics
If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, both systems are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

# Notes
## Nuclear Instability
Four forms of radioactive decay:
1. Alpha, $\alpha$
2. Beta Positive, $\beta^+$
3. Beta Negative, $\beta^-$
4. Gamma Radiation, $\gamma$
## Nuclear Transmutation
A radioactive nucleus emits energy and a particle to become stable.
Unstable nucleus -> parent nucleus
Stable nucleus -> daughter nucleus

## Ionizing Radiation
Energy released from radiation can break molecular bonds and remove electrons from atoms, resulting in positive ion and free electrons.

Alpha -> heavy -> paper can block
Beta -> medium
Gamma -> Goes through everything but lead

## Antimatter
Antimatter has anti-particles. Opposite charge.
For example, electron has charge of -1, so antimatter electron has +1. It is the same in every other way.

## Types of Decay
### Alpha Decay
Alpha decay occurs because there is an excess of protons *and* neutrons in the nucleus such that the size of the nucleus exceeds the range of the Strong Nuclear Force.

An alpha particle is emitted, which reduces the size of the nucleus by emitting excess mass.

The alpha particle (helium nucleus) reduces the size of the nucleus by 4 nucleons, increasing stability. This particle can be stopped by a sheet of paper.

It's ionizing ability (ability to knock electrons off) is high due to 2+ charge.

### Beta Positive Decay
Beta positive decay occurs when there is an excess of protons in the nucleus. The excess positive charge creates excess electrostatic repulsion.

A proton turns into a neutron, reducing the atomic number by 1 while keeping atomic mass the same.

A beta positive particle (positron) is emitted to conserve charge, as well as a neutrino, resulting in a more stable daughter nucleus

It has moderate ionizing ability, due to 1- or 1+ charge.

### Beta Negative Decay
Beta negative decay occurs when there is an excess of neutrons in the nucleus. This creates an unstable ratio of nucleons.

A neutron turns into a proton, increasing the atomic number by 1 while keeping the atomic mass the same.

A beta negative particle (electron) is emitted to conserve charge, as well as an anti-neutrino, resulting in a more stable daughter nucleus

It has moderate ionizing ability, due to 1- or 1+ charge.

## Neutrinos
A neutrino is a tiny, neutral and almost massless particle that is always seen in association with a positron (anti-electron).
An anti-neutrino has almost the same properties as a neutrino but is seen in association with an electron.
