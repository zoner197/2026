**Explain how an overabundance of protons in the nucleus can lead to radioactive decay**
Protons increase the electrostatic repulsive force in the nucleus, because like-charges repel each other and protons have the same charge (1+). If there are too many protons, the strong nuclear force is overpowered by the electrostatic repulsive force, thus making the nucleus unstable. The strong nuclear force is a strong force that occurs when particles are very close to each other. Because there are too many protons, beta positive decay occurs and the nucleus emits positrons and neutrinos.

**Model answer:**
- To undergo spontaneous decay, the nucleus is unstable 1 mark
- Instability is caused by excess electrostatic repulsion exceeding the strong nuclear force 1 mark
- Nucleus will undergo beta positive decay 1 mark
- Describe process of decay ... CANT FUCKING SEE THE REST FROM BACK HERE

An excess of protons can create instability in the nucleus leading to spontaneous decay.
This is due to the protons excess electrostatic repulsion which can overpower the strength of the strong nuclear force. This will cause beta positive decay. This is where a proton transforms into a neutron, and a positron is emitted to conserve charge, leaving behind a more stable daughter nucleus.

# Notes
## Decay Types
![[Decay Equations and Decay Series.png]]
Beta negative decay. Produces electron and antineutrino.

## Decay Equations

### Balancing Nuclear Equations
#### Example: Uranium-238 decaying into Thorium
![[Decay Equations and Decay Series-2.png]]
This equation is balanced because the mass number of the left equals the mass number on the right:
$$238 = 234 + 4$$
AND the atomic number matches
$$92 = 90 + 2 $$

#### Example 2
247_96_Cm -> ? + 4_2_He + gamma

247 - 4 = 243
96 - 2 = 94

243_94_Pu = ?

#### Questions
230_91_Pa -> 230_90_Th + 0_+1_e
10_6_C -> 10_5_B + 0_+1_e
14_6_C -> 14_7_N + 0_-1_e
228_89_Ac -> 228_90_Th + 0_-1_e

**Radium-233 emits an alpha particle during decay**

Radium-233 -> Radon-229 + Helium-4 + Gamma`

**Carbon-14 undergoes a beta negative decay**

`Carbon-14 -> Nitrogen-14 + Electron + Neutrino`

**Bromine-78 undergoes a beta positive decay**

`Bromine-78 -> Selenium-78 + Positron + Antineutrino + Gamma`

## Decay Series
A decay series is a sequence of nuclides formed by successive radioactive decays until a stable decay product, the end product, is formed.
