Alright, Kavii. Here’s the mission brief — clean, sharp, no fluff.

## 🚀 The Task (FIA1 – Technical Proposal, 25%)

You are pitching an **Apple Watch app** to a company called _FocusED_.

The app must help senior students improve:

- Focus
    
- Stress management
    
- Time awareness
    
- Wellbeing
    

And it must:

1. **Collect data** (sensor data like heart rate + user input)
    
2. **Process it with algorithms**
    
3. **Give meaningful feedback**
    

You’re presenting this as a **multimodal technical proposal (max 10 mins)**.

# 🎬 Structure of Your Presentation

## 1️⃣ Introduction (~1 min)

You explain:

- The **problem scope** (students stressed, distracted, etc.)
    
- Constraints (Apple Watch limitations, small screen, battery, etc.)
    
- Existing solutions (other focus/stress apps)
    
- Why they aren’t enough
    
- Your proposed direction
    

---

## 2️⃣ The User Story (~4 mins)

This is the core.

You must:

- Identify required features (e.g., stress tracking, focus timer, break reminders)
    
- Identify usability principles:
    
    - Accessibility
        
    - Effectiveness
        
    - Safety
        
    - Utility
        
    - Learnability
        
- Show **annotated UI sketches**
    
    - Linked screens
        
    - Labels
        
    - Arrows
        
    - Gestures
        
    - Explanations of UX decisions
        
- Identify **which features need algorithms**
    
- Write **pseudocode**
    
- Explain how the algorithms work and why they’re appropriate
    

Think like both:

- 🧑‍🎓 User
    
- 👨‍💻 Developer
    

---

## 3️⃣ Proposed Solution (~4 mins)

You:

- Describe development tools (Swift, Xcode, watchOS)
    
- Convert pseudocode → Swift
    
- Show a **low-fidelity prototype** (PowerPoint, Keynote, Marvel etc.)
    

⚠ Important: Prototype is non-coded. It just shows interface relationships.

---

## 4️⃣ Conclusion (~1 min)

You:

- Justify current version using data
    
- Suggest improvements for future versions
    
- Reference properly (APA)

This isn’t just “make an app idea.”

It’s:  
**Think like a systems designer. Defend like an engineer. Present like a CEO candidate.**
