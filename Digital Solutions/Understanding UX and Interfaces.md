# Notes
## Usability Principles
### Accessibility
Make applications usable for everyone.

### Effectiveness
Applications should do what they're supposed to do to an acceptable standard.

### Safety
Applications shouldn't cause/enable harm.
(e.g. Memory leak giving away privileged function pointers, no chat filter, etc...)

### Utility
Applications should provide *at least* the functionality the user would expect.

### Learnability
Applications should be easy to learn intuitively.
