# Structure

## Folders

`README.md` - This
`Subject/` - Base and notes for each subject
`templates/` - Note templates to quickly start writing
Any additional folders are for projects, ideas, and other personal files.

## Bases

Every subject folder contains a base `Subject.base`. The base provides a UI which groups notes by term, going from term 4 to term 1. Card and table views are provided, both of which show the status and difficulty of each topic.

## Notes

Each note `topic.md` starts with a *frontmatter* which contains the properties of the note (e.g. subject, topic, date, difficulty). The rest of the note is composed of sections such as Retrieval, Notes, and Summary.
